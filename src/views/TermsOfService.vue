            Welcome to the SuperFansOnly website, owned and operated by SuperFansOnly ("SuperFansOnly," "we," "us" or "our"). 
            <br/>
            These Terms of Use (these "Terms") govern your access to and use of the SuperFansOnly website; including without limitation the creation, purchase, sale, exchange, or modification of certain digital assets; our online and/or mobile services, and software provided on or in connection with those services (collectively, the "Service").

            This Service also allows you to sell and purchase Crypto Assets (as defined below) via auction ("Auction"). Detailed rules regarding the Auction process are available on this page, Auction Rules. You may only participate in the Auction by linking your digital wallets on supported bridge extensions such as MetaMask (https://metamask.io/). MetaMask is an electronic wallet, which allows you to purchase, store, and engage in transactions using Binance cryptocurrency. Before putting up your unique digital asset for Auction or putting in an offer to purchase a unique digital asset from another user, we will ask you to download a supported electronic wallet extension, and connect and unlock your digital wallets with that extension. Once you submit an order to sell or purchase a unique digital asset, your order is passed on to the applicable extension, which completes the transaction on your behalf. 
          </p>
          <p class="control pl-5" :class="darkMode ? 'darkText' : ''"> 
            "Crypto Assets" refers to unique non-fungible tokens, implemented on the Binance blockchain (the "Binance Platform") using smart contracts.

To begin an arbitration proceeding, you must send a letter requesting arbitration and describing your claim to our registered agent XXXXXXXXXXXXXX The arbitration will be conducted by JAMS, an established alternativ e dispute resolution provider. Disputes involving claims and counterclaims under $250,000, not inclusive of attorneys’ fees and interest, shall be subject to JAMS’s most current version of the Streamlined Arbitration Rules and procedures available at http://www.jamsadr.com/rules-streamlined-arbitration/; all other claims shall be subject to JAMS’s most current version of the Comprehensive Arbitration Rules and Procedures, available at http://www.jamsadr.com/rules-comprehensive-arbitration/. JAMS’s rules are also available at jamsadr.com or by calling JAMS at 800-352- 5267. If JAMS is not available to arbitrate, the parties will select an alternative arbitral forum. If the arbitrator finds that you cannot afford to pay JAMS’s filing, administrative, hearing and/or other fees and cannot obtain a waiver from JAMS, SuperFansOnly will pay them for you. In addition, SuperFansOnly will reimburse all such JAMS’s filing, administrative, hearing and/or other fees for claims totaling less than $10,000 unless the arbitrator determines the claims are frivolous. You may choose to have the arbitration conducted by telephone, based on written submissions, or in person in the country where you live or at another mutually agreed location. Any judgment on the award rendered by the arbitrator may be entered in any court of competent jurisdiction.

An arbitrator can award on an individual basis the same damages and relief as a court and must follow these Terms as a court would. However, there is no judge or jury in arbitration, and court review of an arbitration award is subject to very limited review.
